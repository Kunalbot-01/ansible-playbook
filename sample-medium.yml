# Medium configuration
# --------------------
#
# This is a good start for larger configurations.
# Just scale the client counts and cache/memory.
#
# This targets a medium server::
#
#     RAM: 2048MB
#     Cores: 2


# Things you MUST change
# ----------------------

# If you do not have a Munin monitor running, comment out the
# muninnode_query_ips and uncomment the line below:

# install_muninnode: no


# Major settings
# --------------

# Plone 4.3.x, 5.0.x and 5.1.x are currently tested and working.
# Make sure this setting is quoted so that it's interpreted as a string.
plone_version: '5.2rc2-pending'

# 2 clients
plone_client_count: 2

# smallish
plone_zodb_cache_size: 15000

# and enforce that with a memory-monitor
plone_client_max_memory: 750MB

# with multiple clients, the "cron" hot monitor does a better job of avoiding downtime.
